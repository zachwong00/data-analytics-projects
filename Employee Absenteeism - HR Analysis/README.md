# Employee Absenteeism - HR Insights

### Project Goal
Investigate the absenteeism of employees with a provided dataset from HR in order to surface recommendations on minimizing absenteeism.

## Business Objectives & Tasks
The HR team are planning to optimize their allocated budget, and would like to understand the organization's employee absence rates and how they could achieve **(1)lower absenteeism levels** and **(2)implement appropriate employee wellness programs.**

As the data analyst within the organization, the HR team assigned a few tasks for the analyst:
1. Provide a list of healthy and low absenteeism individuals for the organization's wellness bonus program.
2. Analyze the employee's absenteeism based on key metrics (hours & reasons), segmented by fiscal quarters.

## Insights
- **High Absenteeism on Mondays:** The highest absenteeism hours occur on Mondays (1,489 hrs), indicating potential burnout or lack of motivation after the weekend.
- **Seasonal Patterns:** Absenteeism peaks in certain months, notably in March (765 hrs) and July (734 hrs), suggesting seasonality impacts.
- **Workload Impacts:** Higher workload average tend to lead to higher absenteeism rates compared to the average absenteeism hours (more than 7.02 hrs), possible due to burnouts and affected mental health.
- **Absent Reasons:** Majority of employee absenteeism reasons are health-related issues; (1) medical consultation [149 submissions] and (2) dental consultation [112 submissions].
- **Employee Health Status:** While a little over half of the employees are under Normal BMI, the remaining 47% of employees are considered overweight (106 employees) and obese (244 employees), possibly contributing to frequent absenteeism.

## Recommendations & Next Steps
1. **Health-Check Programs**
    - Create targeted health and wellness initiatives to focus on physical health awareness, conduct health screenings and weight management for employees to reduce health-related absenteeism and assist in managing their health status.
2. **Implement flexible working arrangements**
    - Introduce flexible work hours or remote work options to employees, especially on Mondays to combat high absenteeism at the start of the week.
    - Consider a 4-day in-office work arrangement as pilot test for one fiscal quarter, compare KPIs and HR metrics to see if this impacts absenteeism positively.
3. **Workload Distribution** 
    - Analyze and adjust workload distribution by engaging further with relevant departments, particularly for working roles with higher absenteeism to prevent burnout.
    - Conduct a quarterly anonymous HR survey to receive employees' workload amount and ratings, as higher workloads correlate with higher absenteeism.
4. **Seasonal Adjustments**
    - Consider adjusting work schedules or providing additional support during peak months, such as March and July by implementing workload balancing strategies. Investigate further into the factors leading to the high absenteeism levels for those specific months.
    - Suggest aligning leave policies with seasonal absenteeism trends, potentially offering more work flexibility during peak absenteeism months.
