## Insights
Insights are extracted based on these key metrics and dimensions: **subscription sales, plan type, period and region**.

### Subscription Plan Type
- Subscribers with the Pro plan consistently brought in the most sales, with a total of $10,984K and dominates the majority of the subscription mix distribution consistenly.
- Enterprise subscriptions had the highest spike compared to other plans at the start of the pandemic, with a record-high of $230K in weekly subscription sales in March 2020. The spike then significantly declined and slowed down in 2020, but received two more weekly sales spikes in April 2021 ($147K) and May 2021 ($137K) before another decline and stabilizing sales.
- Business subscriptions contributed the lowest to the total sales ($4,602K), rarely dominates the share of other plans and completely dropped off when approaching towards the end of 2021.
  
### Subscription Period
- Yearly subscription plans make up 95% of the subscriptions across 2020 to 2021.
- There was a record-high spike in March 2020, bringing in subscription sales worth $382K.
- Yearly subscription plans experienced notable drop-off nearing the end of 2021, whereas monthly subscription plans maintained consistent sales.
   
### Subscription by Region
- The NA region significantly dominates all other regions, with a total of $11,372K in susbcription sales, followed by the EMEA region, APAC region, LATAM region and others.
- Subscriptions in the NA region also experienced the highest spike in weekly sales with a record-high of $243K.
- Interestingly, the APAC region had two unusual weekly susbcription sales spikes in April 2021 and May 2021, at $116K and $117K respectively.
- Evidently, all spikes seen contributed to the sales for the Enterprise subscription plan. 

## Recommendations & Next Steps
**1.Optimize Strategies for Subscription Plan Type**
- Investigate further with the drop-off with Business subscription plan, whether a new competitor is present in the market or an issue with the plan (pricing or features adjustments required to improve and retain subscriptions)
- The Pro subscription plan showed consistent strong sales performance, continue promoting this plan with exclusive deals.
- Investigate why Enterprise plans exhibit a steep dip in the middle of the year and expand this analysis to include additional years to examine whether this trend is speicifically COVID-related or consistent across time. Consider if implementing a product feature could combat this dip.

**2.Leverage Yearly Subscriptions**
- Yearly plans have a dominant share and steady performance. Enhance benefits (e.g., free 1-month trial, discounts or extended support) to encourage more annual subscription commitments.

**3.Region Targets**
- With the NA region showing best performance, prioritize marketing efforts and campaigns in this region to maintain and expand its customer base.
- The EMEA region showed the most volatility - investigate whether there are features or targeted promotions that could stabilize this region's subscriptions and sales.
